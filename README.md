# Madoko for VSCode

This extension brings syntax coloring support for the [Madoko] language
([Github]) designed by Daan Leijen as a showcase for his new [Koka] language.

Madoko is a nice markdown dialect as well as a great editor "Ã  la Sharelatex".

This extension is basically a copy-paste of the `.tmLanguage` files that
are available in the madoko repository. The file extensions are `.mdk` and
`.madoko`.
